# Functional reducibility of higher-order networks

This repository contains the code used for the analysis presented in the paper:  
"Functional reducibility of higher-order networks",  
by M. Lucas, L. Gallo, A. Ghavasieh, F. Battiston, and M. De Domenico  
[arXiv:2404.08547](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08547) (2024)  

### Contents
- `notebooks/`: notebooks used to produce the figures and simple simulations
- `src/`: modules with functions used in the notebooks and heavier simulation scripts
- `results/`: simulation outputs saved for plotting

### Dependencies

The code was tested for Python 3.9 and the dependencies specified in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

In particular, the code relies on the [XGI library](https://github.com/ComplexGroupInteractions/xgi).
